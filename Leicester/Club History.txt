Leicester City Football Club is an English professional football club based in 
Leicester in the East Midlands. The club competes in the Premier League, the top 
division of England's football league system, and plays its home matches at the 
King Power Stadium.

The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse F.C., playing on a field near 
Fosse Road. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891, were elected to the Football 
League in 1894 and adopted the name Leicester City in 1919. They moved to the 
nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002, which was renamed the King Power Stadium in 2011.

Leicester won the 2015–16 Premier League, their first top-level football championship. 
They are one of only seven clubs to have won the Premier League since its inception 
in 1992. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest 
sporting shock ever; multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long odds for 
any sport. As a result, the team was dubbed "The Unbelievables", a spin-off harking 
back to Arsenal's undefeated team "The Invincibles". The club's previous highest 
finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as the First Division.
