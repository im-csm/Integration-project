"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as Tottenham (/ˈtɒtənəm/) 
or Spurs, is an English professional football club in Tottenham, London, that 
competes in the Premier League. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has been the club's 
home ground since April 2019, replacing their former home of White Hart Lane, 
which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Their 
training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield. 
The club is owned by ENIC Group. Tottenham have played in a first (home) strip of 
white shirts and navy blue shorts since the 1898–99 season. The club's emblem is a 
cockerel standing upon a football, with a Latin motto Audere est Facere ("To Dare Is to Do").

Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only 
non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. 
Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA 
Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully 
defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a 
UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup. They were also the inaugural 
winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different
 major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the 
six decades from the 1950s to 2000s – an achievement only matched by Manchester 
United. In total, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, 
seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups. 
Tottenham were also the runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. They have 
a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with whom they contest the North London derby."
