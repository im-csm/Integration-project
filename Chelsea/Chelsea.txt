Chelsea had an average season. The squad was struggling with poor goalkeeping, lack of desire 
in defense, and terrible finishing in the attacking third. 4th was a good placement for Chelsea, 
and set them up for a good run in the Champions League with their and improved squad.

(Chelsea are my favorite team)
