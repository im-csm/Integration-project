"Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester 
that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded 
in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick Association Football Club 
in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester 
Stadium in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road 
since 1923. The club adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894 in the first season 
of the club's current iteration, that have been used ever since.

Manchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their first major honour 
with the FA Cup in 1904. The club had its first major period of success in the late 
1960s, winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the 
management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the 
club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of 
English football for the only time in its history in 1998. They since regained promotion
 to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03.

In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million and 
received considerable financial investment in both playing staff and club facilities, 
including the £150 million Etihad Campus in east Manchester. Under the management of 
Pep Guardiola they won the Premier League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team 
to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an 
unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English 
men's team to win the domestic treble.

Manchester City's revenue was the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 
2018–19 season at €568.4 million. In 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most 
valuable in the world at $2.69 billion, The club is owned by the City Football Group, a 
British-based holding company valued at £3.73 (US$4.8) billion in November 2019 following 
a 10% stake sale to Silver Lake."
